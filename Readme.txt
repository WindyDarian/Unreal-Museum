This is a demo of argumented reality I created with lijiancheng0614(https://github.com/lijiancheng0614) in 2012
It uses a Kinect to detect the position of human head, and apply a calculated matrix between the view matrix and the project matrix (or, alter the projection matrix) of a 3-D scene.
Thus created a illusion of reality for the screen no longer appears as an 2-D plane when you see the screen from different directions.
Most important code at line 183 to line 214 of Illusion\IllusionMain.cs.
